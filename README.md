The Ātmabodh Digital Library serves as a rich repository of literature that nurtures self-awareness by providing access to our cultural, philosophical, and intellectual heritage. It offers valuable resources that help individuals explore and understand the essence of Ātmabodh—awareness of the self in relation to our country’s culture.
